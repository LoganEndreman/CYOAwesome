INTRO

"It was a dark and stormy night..."

"What was so stormy about it?"

"There was a kiss..."

"You've got to be kidding me!"

I started to wonder if I should try to make her feel jealous?
She's deserve it after last Thursday.
Then again, maybe I should try to smooth things over.

- I think we may be in love! [THE_FIGHT]
- It wasn't JUST a kiss! [THE_FIGHT]
- It was nothing. [THE_INTERROGATION]
- Just kidding! There was no kiss. [THE_LIE]
